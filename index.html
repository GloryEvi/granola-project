      <p>
        <em>Granola</em> is a food consisting of rolled oats, nuts, seeds, honey
        or other sweeteners such as brown sugar, and sometimes puffed rice, that
        is usually baked until crisp, toasted and golden brown. The mixture is
        stirred while baking to avoid burning and to maintain a loose breakfast
        cereal consistency. Dried fruit, such as raisins and dates, and
        confections such as chocolate are sometimes added.
